    <!-- Title -->
    <h1 class="title">Nature's Wonders</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <h2>Mountains</h2>
    <p>
        Mountains are a <span class="highlight">beautiful</span> part of nature. Many people love to visit them 
        for hiking and adventure. The air is fresh, and the view from the top 
        is amazing. Some mountains are covered in <span class="highlight">snow</span>, while others have green 
        forests. Mountains are also home to many wild animals.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <h2>Oceans</h2>
    <p>
        Oceans are <span class="highlight">huge</span> and cover most of the Earth. They are full of different 
        sea animals, like fish, sharks, and whales. Many people visit the ocean 
        to swim and relax at the beach. The waves move because of the wind, 
        and the water is salty.
    </p>

    <!-- Third Paragraph -->
    <h2>Forests</h2>
    <p>
        Forests are full of <span class="highlight">trees</span>, plants, and animals. They give us fresh air and 
        help keep the Earth cool. Many animals, like deer, tigers, and birds, 
        live in forests. Trees make the oxygen that we <span class="highlight">breathe</span>, so we must protect 
        forests to keep our planet healthy.
