    <h1 class="title">Amazing Nature</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph -->
    <h2>Mountains</h2>
    <p>
        Mountains are very <span class="highlight">beautiful</span> and full of adventure. Many people love to 
        visit mountains for hiking and relaxation. The air is fresh, and the view 
        is breathtaking. Some mountains are covered in <span class="highlight">snow</span>, while others have 
        green forests. Many animals live in the mountains, including bears and 
        eagles. People enjoy climbing mountains to reach the top. It is a great 
        way to connect with <span class="highlight">nature</span> and feel peaceful.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph -->
    <h2>Oceans</h2>
    <p>
        Oceans are <span class="highlight">huge</span> and cover most of the Earth. They are home to many fish, 
        sharks, and whales. The waves move because of the wind. People love 
        to visit the beach to swim and play in the water. The ocean is very 
        deep, and many <span class="highlight">creatures</span> live in the dark parts of it. Scientists are still 
        discovering new sea animals. Oceans give us food, like fish and crabs, 
        and help keep the air clean.
    </p>

    <!-- Third paragraph -->
    <h2>Forests</h2>
    <p>
        Forests are full of <span class="highlight">trees</span>, plants, and animals. They provide fresh air and 
        help keep the Earth cool. Many animals, like deer, tigers, and birds, 
        live in forests. Trees give us oxygen, which we need to <span class="highlight">breathe</span>. People 
        should take care of forests and not cut down too many trees. Forests 
        are also a great place for camping and adventure.
